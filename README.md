basic CFD code with detailed document description for anyone without any skills
## Learn the CFD form theory to simple code with detailed docunment for basic study
The code was implmented in C or C++ language with Visual Studio IDE, easy for comploation

The finite difference method was used due to its simplicity compared with the finite volume method for coding.

Lid cavity flow was adopted for basic practice.

Parallel code, such as CUDA code or MPI code wil be implemented in the future.
